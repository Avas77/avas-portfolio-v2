Recently, we have introduced a new version of `Datepicker` for our sage platform. The `Datepicker` we have introduced makes it easy
to navigate among different dates easily. Finding and selecting the date is more accessible.

## Features

- âœ¨ Month Selection Section
- âœ¨ Year Selection Section
- âœ¨ Auto validation on blur

### Problems with previous iteration of Datepicker

Although, the previous iteration we have with Datepicker was working as it was meant,
it was causing different problems for the consumers like accessing the date from a given point of year and month,
if the user was using the calendar for navigating, it was deemed very hard for user to select the date.

### Solution

The new version of `Datepicker` mitigates the problems that were caused by previous versions of Datepicker, which allows
more accessible ways of selecting the Date from a specific point of time. The user will feel easy and comfortable while
using
the new version. Basically the new version makes the `Date` navigation more easier and accessible.

### Dependencies used to achieve the Datepicker

- [Dayzed](https://github.com/deseretdigital/dayzed) This is a component that focuses on controlling user interactions
  so you can focus on creating beautiful, accessible, and useful date-pickers.
- [react-number-format](https://github.com/s-yadav/react-number-format) React component to format number in an input or
  as a text

  _At last we would like to thank my amazing colleagues from design team as well as from the Frontend team that helped us
  achieve this component._
