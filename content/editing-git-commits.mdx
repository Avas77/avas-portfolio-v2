Imagine you want to go back in time and change your commits, delete them, merge multiple commits etc.
All this can be achieved using interactive rebase which makes it a powerful tool.

## What is interactive rebase?

It gives an opportunity to alter older individual commits.
It's like `git commit --amend` on steroids.

Scott Chacon, in his book Pro Git, describes interactive rebasing as follows: <blockquote>Sometimes the thing fixed â€¦ cannot be amended to the not-quite perfect commit it fixes, because that commit is buried deeply in a patch series. That is exactly what interactive rebase is for: use it after plenty of [work has been committed], by rearranging and editing commits, and squashing multiple commits into one.</blockquote>

## How do we start

To start an interactive rebase, we need to tell Git which commits to modify and we do this by referencing the commits as shown below.

```
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

- Where `n` is the recent number of commit messages that you want to edit

Lets look at an example.

##### 1. Open commit messages

```
git rebase -i HEAD~1
```

<p>This opens a screen with commit message preceded with letter `pick`</p>

It also shows a list of commands that you would want to use as per your usecase.

##### 2. Replace pick with reword

<p>
  Replace pick with reword for all the commit messages that you want to edit. In
  this case, we are editing 1 message only.{" "}
</p>

##### 3. Editing git commit message

<p>
  After editing commit message, Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> &{" "}
  <kbd>Enter</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> if you are in nano editor
  or Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> & type <b>:wq</b> if you are in vim editor
  respectively.
</p>

##### 4. Verify changes using git log
