Typescript is awesome language. I have been using it for one year now and I my love towards the language is infinity. It's commonly known as the superset of Javascript, but it's much more than that. Typescript helps a lot during the day to day development work, also it helps a lot to avoid the unnecessary painful bugs.

Here, in this articles I am going to present some features ina `Typescript` that you might not know and that may come handy in your day to day life. Are you excited to go through the features?

## @ts-expect-error

Let's assume a case where you have a case where the ts compiling is yelling at you that you are doing something wrong,

```ts
const multiply = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
multiply("12", 13);
```

Here, TS compiler yells at you with the message
`Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type`

Let's say you cannot change the type of the first argument and temporarily want to surpress the error being shown by the TS compiler, normally we use `@ts-ignore` to surpress the error

```ts
const multiply = (a: number, b: number) => a * b;
// @ts-ignore
multiply("12", 13);
```

Now, after some time, you fixed the error and changed the first argument of the `multiply` function from `'12'` to `12`

```ts
const multiply = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
// @ts-ignore
multiply(12, 13);
```

but, you forgot to remove the `@ts-ignore` directive we used previously, so basically it will keep ignoring the next line forever unless you remove it which may cause bug in the future.

So in this case, we can make use of `@ts-expect-error` directive, which does the same job as the `@ts-ignore` directive but as soon as the error is fixed, the TS compiler yells at you

```ts
const multiply = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
// @ts-expect-error
multiply(12, 13);
```

`Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive.`

This reminds you to remove the directive as soon as the error is fixed.

## never type

You have a function that takes an error status code and always throws an error according to the status, the `never` type comes handy when you know a `function` is never going to reach it's end point.

The difference between `never` and `void` is, while `void` means atleast `undefined` or `null` is being returned, `never` means the function's end point is never reached.

```ts
function throwError(error: string): never {
  throw new Error(error);
}
```

## Template Literal Types

Tempplate literal types are similar to string litreral types in javascript but are specific to types. Let's say you have a library that implements a popover and there is a type for positioning the popover

```ts
type popoverPositions =
  | "top"
  | "bottom"
  | "left"
  | "right"
  | "top-left"
  | "top-right"
  | "top-center"
  | "bottom-left"
  | "bottom-right"
  | "bottom-center";
```

It can be hectic to combine all the possible permutations and combinations for all the types

using template literal types, you can separate the directions and combine the types to get a new type that consists of all the possible combinations

```ts
type positions = "top" | "bottom" | "center";
type directions = "left" | "right" | "center";
type popoverPositions = positions | directions | `${positions}-${directions}`;
```

which will generate all the types as

```ts
type popoverPositions =
  | positions
  | directions
  | "top-left"
  | "top-right"
  | "bottom-left"
  | "bottom-right"
  | "center-left"
  | "center-right";
```

## Null assertions

Null assertions basically tells your TS compiler that your value is nor `null` neither `undefined`. Let's say you have initialized the value as
`let myNumber:null | number = null;`
but later on you update the value of myNumber
`myNumber = 69;`

Now, lets assume you have a function that accepts only numbers,

```ts
const add = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return a + b;
};
add(myNumber, 1);
```

The compiler yells at you saying
` Argument of type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.`

So here, you can make use of null assertions width bang `!` in the end of the variable to tell the compiler that the value we are sending is not null

```ts
const add = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return a + b;
};
add(myNumber!, 1);
```

The code above compiles successfully.

## Merging Interfaces

Megring Interfaces is the type of `declaration merging`, when you have two interfeces with the same name, it merges and creates a single interface

```ts
interface Box {
  height: number;
  width: number;
}
interface Box {
  scale: number;
}
let box: Box = { height: 5, width: 6, scale: 10 };
```

So here, we can create two separate interfaces with the same name which in turn gets merged to a single one and can be used as per the example mentioned above.

I hope, you learnt something new from the list above.
